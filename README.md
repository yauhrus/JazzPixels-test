Test task for JazzPixels.

How to check functional what I made.

Homepage.

1. Slider with images works with swipe(no autoplay). Text/icon content changing everytime on swipe.
2. Every item on feed desk is swipable. Swipe to the right on item opening the box to add/delete this song/video/event to/from bookmarked. Tap on item/left swipe closing this box. You will see bookmarked icon on the right top of the item if it was added to bookmarked.
3. Navigation is fixed only for home page. Pressing second icon on navigation from left you will be redirected to another page-Map.html

Map.

1. Press on events button(bottom left side circle) to see events list(functional is the same from Homepage 2 paragraph). To hide events list press on small orange rectangle on top of the list.
2. To go back to homepage press first icon from left on navigation bar.

Tested on Iphone 6s/X. To check it on desktop - open the device simulator to have touch events.
